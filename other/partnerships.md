## Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA)

[digitalpublicgoods.net](https://digitalpublicgoods.net)

The Digital Public Goods Alliance is a multi-stakeholder UN-endorsed initiative that accelerates the attainment of the sustainable development goals by facilitating the discovery, development, use of, and investment in digital public goods. 

Read more: https://digitalpublicgoods.net/who-we-are/

The concept of digital public goods derives from the economic term “public good” which refers to something that is non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Non-excludability indicates that you cannot prevent someone from using or consuming that good. Non-rivalrousness indicates that one’s consumption or usage does not limit or take away from someone else’s.

### Why should a digital solution become a DPG?

Being recognised as a digital public good is increasingly beneficial as the concept of digital public goods gains awareness and traction, including: 

- **Recognition** **as** **adhering to a minimum standard which increases adoptability**. Digital public goods must meet the requirements set out in the [Digital Public Goods Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/). Digital public goods have clear documentation, open licenses, and follow standards and best practices that make them easier to adopt. We support digital solutions working to meet these standards. 

- **Discoverability and promotion**. The [Digital Public Goods Registry](http://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/) uniquely shares digital public goods with a broad audience of stakeholders including governments, NGOs, and the private sector. As an added bonus, the DPG Registry is partially compiled from, and feeds back into, partner systems like the [Catalog of Digital Solutions](https://solutions.dial.community/products) maintained by the Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL). This method of cross-pollination enhances discoverability and accelerates the likelihood of a nominee being found and adopted by organisations and governments looking for innovative solutions.

- **Deployment opportunities**. The Digital Public Goods Alliance aims to showcase digital public goods and works with an array of stakeholders including governments, UN agencies, and others in promoting DPGs. This includes potential added exposure through [DPGA Communities of Practice](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/what-we-do/) who review digital solutions with high-impact potential in a particular focus area.

- **Development impact.** Governments and development agencies are reframing approaches to international development with a focus on creating and adapting open-source projects. Digital public goods are committed to open-source principles that also respect privacy, strive to “do no harm”, and help attain the SDGs.

- Participate in a **global community** of DPG builders. Once a digital solution becomes a digital public good, they become a part of [global community of DPG practitioners](http://www.digitalpublicgoods.net/community) to exchange experiences and share knowledge with peers and experts.

I am interested to look up the technologies used by DPGs to get a lay of the land and find any laravel projects

## Develop For Good 

https://www.developforgood.org/

This is possibly the closest thing I have found the the giftware.io vision.

* DFG manage teams of volunteers - talented, diverse college students and industry professionals to build tech products for nonprofits.
* Students gain hands-on technical experience, corporate mentors donate their skills, and nonprofits get quality, custom digital services.
* See [home page](https://www.developforgood.org/) for impressive impact stats, significant list of corporate/tech sponsors
* Non-profits can submit project ideas through [their form here](https://airtable.com/appcOdqCMHAlxDqDZ/shruLN89s4IRSHKde)
* Projects are run in 16 week blocks
* Non-profits pay a $1,000 flat fee per project block
* Projects must come under one of 3 project types - Website & app design, Web & mobile app development, or Data science & analytics, all of which have standard/approved technologies and tools that can be used.
* DFG are a non-profit themselves who raise funds through [zeffy.com](zeffy.com), which is an interesting project itself

### Key takeaways

- Utilising available students/graduates as a valuable resource, while giving them valuable opportunities for real-world project experience and mentoring 
- Great example of project submission process
- Proof of model

## Eco-Index

**Guiding biodiversity investment in Aotearoa New Zealand**

Biodiversity in Aotearoa New Zealand continues to decline. So we are delivering fresh solutions: A bold, research-backed vision for 100 years of ecological restoration.   
An open access [Ecosystem Reconstruction Map](https://eco-index.nz/ecosystem-restoration-map) to guide land management decisions.
Advanced [AI and remote sensing algorithms](https://eco-index.nz/ai-remote-sensing-tools) to assess biodiversity from satellite imagery.

> *Research shows that the game changes if we can reach at least 15% native ecosystem coverage. This means protecting ecosystems that are above 15% of their expected natural range and reconstructing those that have fallen below.*

## Optimi

[optimi.co.nz](https://www.optimi.co.nz/)


NZ based for-profit agency that helps non-profits by providing no/low-code digital solutions to "*Optimise, automate, and empower your nonprofit*."

> *From reporting dashboards and knowledge bases to automation and everything in between, our team provides the thinking and strategy to help you leverage existing tools that make your job easier and empower your people, so you can focus on the important things*

### Similarities and differences

Same mission to support and empower non-profits, different class of digital solution (low/no-code).

### Potential for collaboration

giftware.io can refer work to Optimi where custom development is not necessary to solve a probelm. Optimi could refer work back to giftware.io where custom development is required.
