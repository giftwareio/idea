### The Problem

1. **Lack of Funding for Critical Issues:** Many organisations doing critically important, meaningful work lack the funding to develop web/software applications that would empower them to do their best work. 
2. **Lack of Meaningful Work:** Many web/software professionals seek opportunities to apply their skills to meaningful causes but often settle for jobs that just pay the bills. 
3. **Resource Misallocation**: Existing talent and resources in the tech industry are underutilised for social/environmental projects.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Talent Pool:** A network of skilled web/software professionals ready to contribute to positive impact open-source projects.
2. **Funding Platform**: Raising and managing funds to support project development and sustainability.
3. **Project Matching**: Identifying and matching for optimal opportunities with available talent and resources.
