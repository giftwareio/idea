# The Problem

## Lack of Resources Available for Critical Global Issues

According to the [Sustainable Development Goals Report 2024](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2024), with just six years remaining, current progress falls far short of what is required to meet the SDGs. Without massive investment and scaled up action, the achievement of the SDGs — the blueprint for a more resilient and prosperous world and the roadmap out of current global crises — will remain elusive.

The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2024 makes for sobering reading. It finds that only 17 per cent of the SDG targets are on track, nearly half are showing minimal or moderate progress, and progress on over one third has stalled or even regressed.

For most of us, the scale and complexity of these issues are simply overwhelming. 
## Lack of Meaningful Work Opportunities

Traditional employment and economic structures prioritise profit over purpose, efficiency over innovation, and routine over creativity. This focus results in a workforce that is underutilised and unfulfilled.

Studies show that meaningfulness is more important to employees than any other aspect of their jobs, including pay, rewards, promotions, and working conditions.

In the recent [2024 StackOverflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024), only [19% of 29k respondents indicated they were satisfied in their job](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/professional-developers#3-satisfied-at-current-job).

### The cause 

TODO: This goes pretty deep, feels like a bucket of worms
  
Several factors contribute to the lack of meaningful work:

1. **Economic Pressures:** Many job markets prioritise profitability and efficiency over purpose and impact, leading to roles that focus on routine tasks rather than innovative solutions that improve our lives.
2. **Cultural Norms:** Societal expectations and norms can pressure individuals into pursuing conventional career paths, even if they do not find them fulfilling or impactful.
3. **Educational Gaps:** Educational systems often fail to equip individuals with the skills and mindset needed to pursue meaningful work, focusing instead on traditional metrics of success.
4. **Organisational Structures:** Many organisations have hierarchical structures that limit individual creativity and initiative, stifling opportunities for meaningful contributions.
5. **Limited Awareness:** There is often a lack of awareness or access to opportunities that align with individual values and skills, leaving people unaware of how they can make a difference.
6. **Evolutionary Tendencies**: While humans may have evolutionary tendencies to focus on local group issues, cultural evolution and intrinsic motivations demonstrate that people can and do engage with broader, systemic challenges when given the right conditions and incentives.

### The Impact

The lack of meaningful work has profound implications:

1. **Wasted Potential**: Highly capable individuals are not given the opportunity to apply their skills to solve pressing global issues.
2. **Mental Health**: A lack of purpose and engagement in work can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and depression.
3. **Economic Costs**: Disengaged employees are less productive and don't stay in their roles for long, leading to significant economic losses for businesses and economies.
4. **Societal Stagnation**: Without innovative thinking and problem-solving, societal progress slows, and critical issues remain unaddressed.
5. **Acceleration**: New, powerful technologies risk being employed primarily for profit driven objectives that amplify the negative impacts of ...._____ todo 

### The Opportunity

To truly harness human potential, we must create opportunities for meaningful work that utilise individuals' skills and talents for causes they care about. By shifting our focus to work that matters, we can…
  
- **Empower Individuals:** Providing meaningful work empowers people to offer their talents to something bigger than themselves, leading to greater personal fulfilment.
- **Foster Innovation:** Engaged and motivated individuals are more likely to think creatively and develop innovative solutions.
- **Enhance Wellbeing:** Meaningful work can improve mental health and overall wellbeing, contributing to a more positive and productive society.
- **Drive Progress:** By aligning work with the most pressing global issues, we can accelerate progress towards a sustainable, equitable and beautiful world.

Without viable pathways to engage in impactful work, many skilled professionals may experience burnout or leave their invaluable potential for positive societal impact untapped.

There is a lack of sufficient funding and support structures for technology projects that promise high social or environmental returns but lack immediate commercial viability.

This affects a wide range of potential innovations in sectors like healthcare, environmental conservation, and education, particularly in under-resourced communities.

Without innovation in these areas, society risks failing to solve urgent challenges or improve the quality of life for vulnerable populations.

Traditional funding models for tech projects are often misaligned with the goals of social impact, focusing instead on profitability and short-term outcomes.
