# Mission & Vision

Open-source Software for the uplifting of the world.

### MISSION

Our mission is to design, develop, and maintain open-source software solutions that enhance the wellbeing of individuals and the environment. We focus on problems that are most worth solving through evaluating, funding, and nurturing digital projects that support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

### VISION

Our vision is to harness untapped resources and talent from the tech industry to drive positive change through innovative, open-source projects. We aspire to build an open, collaborative ecosystem that fosters creativity, inclusivity, and sustainability.


## Why Open-source

1. **Resource efficiency**: If we develop something that can support positive change in the world, we want that something to be accessible to anyone to use or re-purpose.
2. **Transparency and Trust:** Open-source software promotes transparency, enabling users to inspect, modify, and improve the code. This builds trust and encourages community involvement.
3. **Collaboration and Innovation:** Open-source projects foster a collaborative environment where diverse ideas and expertise come together, driving innovation and improving solutions through collective effort.
4. **Sustainability:** Open-source solutions can be continuously improved and maintained by a global community, ensuring long-term sustainability and adaptability to changing needs.
5. **Cost-Effectiveness:** By leveraging open-source software, organisations can reduce costs associated with proprietary software, making advanced technology accessible to non-profits, startups, and under-resourced communities.
6. **Empowerment:** Open-source software empowers individuals and communities to take control of technology, customise it to their needs, and contribute to its development, fostering a sense of ownership and engagement.

## Why UN SDGs 


The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. 

Hereâ€™s why we align our mission with these goals:

1. **Comprehensive Framework:** The UN SDGs provide a comprehensive framework that addresses a wide range of global challenges, from poverty and hunger to health, education, and climate change. By aligning our projects with these goals, we ensure that our efforts are focused on the most critical issues facing humanity and the planet.

2. **Global Consensus:** The UN SDGs have been adopted by all 193 United Nations Member States, representing a global consensus on the priorities for sustainable development. By supporting these goals, we join a worldwide movement of governments, businesses, and civil society organisations working together towards common objectives.

3. **Holistic Approach:** The SDGs encompass 17 interconnected goals that recognise the need for an integrated approach to development. This holistic perspective ensures that our projects consider the interdependencies between social, economic, and environmental factors, leading to more effective and sustainable solutions.

4. **Measurable Targets:** Each SDG includes specific targets and indicators that provide a clear roadmap for progress. This allows us to set measurable goals for our projects, track our impact, and continuously improve our strategies to achieve meaningful outcomes.

5. **Sustainability:** The core principle of the SDGs is sustainability, which aligns with our commitment to creating long-lasting, positive change. By focusing on sustainable development, we ensure that our solutions contribute to the wellbeing of current and future generations.

6. **Inclusivity:** The SDGs emphasise leaving no one behind, promoting inclusivity and equality. Our projects strive to empower marginalised communities and ensure that everyone has access to the benefits of technological advancements.

7. **Inspiration and Motivation:** The SDGs inspire and motivate individuals and organisations to contribute to a better world. By aligning our mission with these goals, we tap into a powerful source of inspiration and drive that fuels our commitment to making a difference.
