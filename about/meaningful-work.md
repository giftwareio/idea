Many professionals seek meaningful ways to apply their skills for broader societal benefit while balancing personal and family responsibilities. There is a need for opportunities that allow for fulfilling work that is aligned with personal values, without neglecting the increasing financial demands and responsibilities of living costs, raising families etc.

In the fast-paced tech industry, professionals often face high-demand roles that offer little in terms of social impact. This can lead to dissatisfaction for those driven by a desire to contribute to societal and environmental well-being.

Without viable pathways to engage in impactful work, many skilled professionals may experience burnout or leave untapped potential for positive societal impact.

There is a lack of sufficient funding and support structures for technology projects that promise high social or environmental returns but lack immediate commercial viability.

  

New, powerful technologies risk being employed primarily for profit driven objectives that have a detrimental impact on society.

Many critical areas in social and environmental sectors cannot promise quick financial returns, deterring traditional investment despite their potential for long-term societal benefit.

This affects a wide range of potential innovations in sectors like healthcare, environmental conservation, and education, particularly in under-resourced communities.

Without innovation in these areas, society risks failing to solve urgent challenges or improve the quality of life for vulnerable populations.

Traditional funding models for tech projects are often misaligned with the goals of social impact, focusing instead on profitability and short-term outcomes.
