# Open Source

## What is Open-Source Software?

Open-source software is software with its source code made publicly available, allowing anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute it. Unlike proprietary software, open-source encourages collaboration and transparency, with developers worldwide contributing to its improvement. This model fosters innovation, security, and accessibility, empowering individuals and organisations to leverage advanced technology without licensing fees and restrictions.

## Why Open-Source?

By embracing the open-source model, we commit to creating software that is not only powerful and innovative but also accessible and beneficial to all, driving meaningful change on a global scale.

1. **Resource efficiency**: If we develop something that can support positive change in the world, we want that something to be accessible to anyone to use or re-purpose.
2. **Transparency and Trust:** Open-source software promotes transparency, enabling users to inspect, modify, and improve the code. This builds trust and encourages community involvement.
3. **Collaboration and Innovation:** Open-source projects foster a collaborative environment where diverse ideas and expertise come together, driving innovation and improving solutions through collective effort.
4. **Sustainability:** Open-source solutions can be continuously improved and maintained by a global community, ensuring long-term sustainability and adaptability to changing needs.
5. **Cost-Effectiveness:** By leveraging open-source software, organisations can reduce costs associated with proprietary software, making advanced technology accessible to non-profits, startups, and under-resourced communities.
6. **Empowerment:** Open-source software empowers individuals and communities to take control of technology, customise it to their needs, and contribute to its development, fostering a sense of ownership and engagement.
